# Perceived and Measured Associations Between Attractiveness and Key Traits: A Bayesian Meta-Analysis

The relationship between attractiveness and a variety of traits, such as intelligence, health, sociability, and dominance, remains a topic of debate in the current literature. This study aims to clarify the equivocal findings surrounding these associations by exploring both the actual correlations and how people perceive them. Specifically, we investigate whether individuals systematically overestimate or underestimate these associations. By combining an analysis of the discrepancies between measured and perceived correlations with a meta-analytic synthesis of their reliability, this research tests competing theories of person perception related to attractiveness and its consequences.

## Prompt

I am writing a psychology review paper. This systematic review paper aims to synthesize empirical evidence examining both perceived and measured associations between physical attractiveness and key psychological traits. The review is structured in three interconnected sections to address current ambiguities in the "beauty-is-good" stereotype literature. First, we analyze empirical studies investigating actual correlations between attractiveness and objective trait measures (e.g., health, intelligence). Second, we review evidence regarding perceived trait associations - that is, how observers attribute characteristics like intelligence, kindness, or social skills based on physical appearance. Third, we integrate these findings through theoretical lenses (including evolutionary psychology and social cognition frameworks) to identify well-established associations versus persistent contradictions in the literature. By systematically comparing objective measurements with perception studies, this review seeks to clarify whether attractiveness-related stereotypes reflect accurate social perceptions or cognitive biases. We conclude by mapping critical knowledge gaps and proposing specific research priorities, particularly emphasizing understudied trait domains and methodological considerations for disentangling correlation from causation in attractiveness research.

Although I have not finish writing the paper, I have attached the proposal. The proposal includes some of the evidence I need and framed as doing a meta-analysis. Based on my description above and the proposal, writing the formal review paper for me. Here are the requirements:

1. Although the proposal says it is a meta-analysis, do not frame it as a meta-analysis. Instead, summarize the key findings in the literature and derive some conclusions.
2. Make sure to search related literature and discuss both perceived and actual association between attractive and the four key traits (intelligence, health, sociability, and dominance).

组织：现有证据模棱两可，而且不确定beauty as good是否就是刻板印象，需要比对真实和感知的相关。本文回顾两部分证据，第一部分是attractiveness和实际的trait的相关，第二个部分考察attractiveness和perceived trait (e.g., perceived intelligence)的相关的证据。第三部分讲相关理论，并探讨哪些关系已经确凿，哪些关系还需要未来的研究，以及具体的研究问题应该是什么。

I am writing a long psychology review paper on the associations between attractiveness and traits such as intelligence and health. Past studies have received contradictory findings, for example, on whether there is a meaningful correlation between attractiveness and intelligence. Please conduct a thorough literature review, summarize the current empirical findings on the association between attractiveness (e.g., physical attractiveness) and key traits (e.g., intelligence), and related theories underlying these associations. There are some requirements: 

1. Make sure your summary include all of the four traits: intelligence, health, sociability, and dominance;
2. Summarize both empirical and theoretical papers;
3. Present the literature review logically. It would be even better if each domain you organize the findings in a chronological order.

This is pretty good. Now continue the literature review, but focus on the associations between attractiveness and perceived traits (e.g., perceived intelligence). For example, you just reviewed papers on the association between attractiveness and measured intelligence, now please conduct thorough literature on the correlation between attractiveness and perceived intelligence. Here are the requirements:

1. First briefly summarize the definition and measurements of attractiveness.
2. Make sure your review include all of the four traits: intelligence, health, sociability, and dominance;
3. Search theories or hypotheses that explain the these correlations.
4. Search theories or hypotheses that address the discrepancy or consistency between perceived and actual associations between attractiveness and the four traits.
5. Present the literature review logically. 

Now, based on the two research you conducted, draft a systematic review paper. This review aims to synthesize empirical evidence examining both perceived and measured associations between physical attractiveness and key psychological traits. It starts with introducing the concept of attractiveness and then the beauty-is-good stereotype. Then, the review is structured in three interconnected sections to address current debated on the "beauty-is-good" stereotype literature. First, we analyze empirical studies investigating actual correlations between attractiveness and objective trait measures (e.g., health, intelligence). Second, we review evidence regarding perceived trait associations - that is, how observers attribute characteristics like intelligence, kindness, or social skills based on physical appearance. Third, we integrate these findings through theoretical lenses (including evolutionary psychology and social cognition frameworks) to identify well-established associations versus persistent contradictions in the literature. By systematically comparing objective measurements with perception studies, this review seeks to clarify whether attractiveness-related stereotypes reflect accurate social perceptions or cognitive biases. We conclude by mapping critical knowledge gaps and proposing specific research priorities, particularly emphasizing understudied trait domains and methodological considerations for disentangling correlation from causation in attractiveness research.

The review should follow the APA style, including different sections like introduction, following sections, conclusions.



## Hypotheses

现有关系：attractiveness, intelligence, health, aggression/dominance (physical strength), baby-faced, prosociality

现有模棱两可的关系：attractiveness-intelligence, attractiveness-health, health-dominance

一些假设：

- 第一层

  这一层测量的是trait本身，比如attractiveness用的是客观数据，具体看看有哪些客观指标。

  - the assortative mating account of intelligence and attractiveness: positive relationship between intelligence and attractiveness

  - the bad gene hypothesis: there is a correlation between attractiveness and intelligence only for low attractiveness

  - the adaptationist perspective of attractiveness: physical attractiveness (e.g., flutuating asymmetry) is positively related to health
  - the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis: masculinity (e.g., facial masculinity) is postively related to health

- 第二层

  - Reality：assortative mating, 积极特质正相关，assortative mating中更强偏好的相关更强，第二，相关是range的函数，range大才能观测到这个相关
  - Perception: experience sampling，相关基本反映reality
  - Perception: experience sampling + self-fulfilling prophecy, 相关基本反应reality，和上一个无法区分
  - Perception: self-fulfilling prophecy, 相关高估，并且信度没有差异，因为已经自我实现，所以可以精准评估
  - Perception: biased sampling/measurement error: 相关和实际有差异，比如高，但是效应量不大，also, no differences in reliability. 
  - Perception: halo effect 1, status generalization theory, attractiveness无差别影响其他，相关比实际高
  - Perception: halo effect 2,attractiveness有差别影响其他，相关比实际高，而且reliability是差别影响的函数
  - Perception: overgeneralization and error management, attractiveness and health膨胀，作者也认为partially explained halo effect，因为是overgeneralization，一定是要超出真实相关
  - Perception: common method bias, 相关比reality高，而且method解释异质性。如果存在这个问题，需要先矫正，然后再比较。或者可以说，所有method中最低的后验仍然是高于真实值的

- reliability

  - method: reliability generalization meta-analysis
  - 怎么计算reliability？如果不是专门的量表，很难。取一部分raw data，然后计算ICC。另外在群体数据的一个方法，还原一整个协方差矩阵，然后生成数据，提取latent factor，看attractiveness的loading是不是都比其他高

要解决的问题：

- 思考gender和age对这个关系的moderation是什么含义
- 看看哪些是attractiveness的客观指标，但是很多empirical都是主观的。怎么会有一个变量又是主观又是客观？
  - 其实不是，看Zebrowitz，主观的是评分，客观的是averageness and symmetry，但是这个不能算attractiveness，因为只是一个客观现实。严格来说在综合时要排除

- 如果存在交叉的测量，比如对于attractiveness的打分和IQ同时测量，如何处理
- 如何确保比较出来r的差异不是construct的差异带来的差异，这个是最大的问题，DongWon的没有问题，因为测的是一样的概念。可以退一步，用尽可能一样的construct，比如attractiveness和intelligence，Dongwon的论文可以提取，就是直接的attractiveness和intelligence的感知。

### intelligence

- gender, 有人认为halo effect 对女性更强，因为IQ的perception非常不准，见Kleisner et al. 出自Talamas et al., 2016
- age: 关乎自我实现的预言，如果是自我实现，随着时间推移这个关系更强。但是由于fertility的下降，考察这个关系时应该去除老年人
- mean of attractiveness (test bad gene hypothesis): 如果是用打分的attractiveness，那么就要把绝对的分数code出来，然后作为一个调节。2015的综述是没做这个的。支持bad gene hypothesis，如果overall r between measured intelligence and attractiveness是正的，则有一个负的系数，否则相反。
- mean of attractiveness (anomalous face overgeneralization hypothesis，对perception): 在perception阶段，不论attractiveness在什么水平，大家都会用这个halo effect，所以这里的moderation effect必定不显著，BF01比较大
- SES：按照LHT，高k factor的个体这两者得分应该更高，但是要确认IQ是一个慢生命史策略，如果是的话，控制了SES以后二者相关为0. 具体来说是童年相关，Hollingshead index
- richness in information: face stimuli是否representative，是否有multimodal information，见Zebrowitz2002的intro

## Simulation: Assortative Mating

一种新的assortative mating理论，是两层的assortment，不是单纯在mate value上，先是mate value，其次不同trait有不同的assortment。另一个模拟，性别二态性的生态理性模型，遗传特征只在某个性别上出现。第三个模拟，overgeneralization，一个范围内有效的全部利用，假设人们只知道ecological correlation，但是不知道condition，即前提。第四个模拟，人们是否用了attractiveness和IQ的生态相关推断个体层面，类似pseudocontingency刻板印象理论，如果group是基于mate value来分的，这个群体中有高IQ，高attractiveness，但是个体层面可能完全没相关。

## Keywords

intelligence: academic performance, intelligence

health：immune function; longevity; mobility；BMI；disease

dominance: 这里要突出的特质是获得资源和争夺地位的trait，而不是仅限于某一个词，凡是能解决这种适应性问题的特质都应该考虑。physical formidability, aggression, fighting-ability, resource-holding potential。facial width-to-height ratio需要再确认

## Inclusion Criteria

考虑到人们可能会sample不同的信息，比如生态理性模型，找校标最好的indicator，在measured trait层面，需要考虑多重因素，比如intelligence，就不是单纯量表，还有学业成绩等。也可以这么理解，人们不是从单一线索得出这些关系，所以一个总的相关是有意义的。但是对judgment，不需要这些，只需要看纯粹的trait就行了

对perception层面，我们只采集没有社会互动的perception，因此就不会考虑所谓的self-fulfilling prophecy。如果出现一致，那么基本就是社会现实

引出主题，what is beauty is good, 1972, 首先说明了这个现象。1991年，Eagly，说what is beauty is good, but..， 指出这些东西并不是一个大而化之的现象，而是在某些地方效应更强，比如social competence, 然后给了三个可能的路径。1992年Feingold,  看了attractiveness和各种perception和personality的关系。然后study3给了对比。1995, Jackson，指出了intelligence和attractiveness的关系，两个大理论，然后看intelligence和A的相关，mixed results

顺着1972年的思路，早期认为这是一种bias。这一块有三个方面的理论，首先是经济学家的，另一块是社会心理学家，第三个是进化心理学。认为这是一种by-product. 基于这个，早期的几个大元分析都给了比较充足的证据。但是这不是全貌，在不知道真实关系的情况下，无法说是bias. 而且的确有理论说明他们应该存在真实相关，比如good gene hypothesis。最早对这个尝试的元分析是Feingold，发现是不支持expectancy effect的。但是接着1995年Jackson发现了相关。类似于一种self-fulfilling prophecy. 引用早期这个理论。

这种真实和perception的差异一直延续至今，并且在各个trait上都有争议，尽管存在这些元分析。首先是智力，2002年Zebrowitz认为A和IQ有关，并且证实了这一点。在她后续的研究，对这个假设进一步完善，提出了bad gene hypothesis和overgeneralization hypothesis。具体来说就是IQ和A只在A低的时候相关。基于这些发现，2004年Kanazawa又提出了assortative mating theory来解释为什么IQ和A相关，并且将其拓展到其他trait，比如dominance上面。这个理论受到了一些证据支持。但是随后2015年和后续的研究又对其进行了挑战，使得IQ和A的关系仍然不清晰。这种争议也存在于health中，早期good gene认为A和health相关，health是一种健康表型，并不是只和疾病联系，但是Zebrowitz没发现相关，后来认为是bad gene hypothesis，仅仅是看疾病的。然而，后续研究也存在A和health的相关，也有说是曲线关系。

这篇元分析看A和四个trait的关联，both person perception and measured traits。选择这四个trait是因为，IQ和health在这些年的结果不一致，而prosociality和dominance是常见的big two dimension，而且和进化相关，比如根据assortative mating theory。所以这篇论文的adding value就是，第一，过了30年，进一步整合empirical studies. 第二，基于过去几十年提出的新理论进行检验，比如assortative mating, version 1, version 2, 比如bad gene hypothesis, overgeneralization 

- Physical appearance is the most accessible information during social interaction. In 1972, a landmark study on physical appearance found that people assumes what is beautiful is good. In another way, people possess attractiveness-related positive bias by attributing physically attractive persons as more socially desirable and more competent (Dion). Subsequent studies reached concensus that this beauty-is-good stereotype is a strong and general phenomenon.

- Coinciding with the first study, researchers considered this tendency to attribute positive traits to attractive persons as a stereotype. Studies from economics, social psychology, and evolutionary psychology provided explanations to this stereotype. 
- The first line of reasoning comes from economists (for a review, see Maestripieri et al, 2017). Becker (1957) suggested that the differential attributions to attractive vs. unattractive people is similar to prejudice. It is a taste-based discrimination regardless of their productivity in the labor market. This account, however, provides no mechanism on why this discrimination originate from and is descriptive rather than explanatory. More relevant explanations were crafted by social psychologists, which can be summarized as stereotype-based theories. One prominent theory is status generalization theory (SGT). According to SGT, external status characteristics (e.g., attractiveness) are used to generate expectations regarding performance without conscious awareness (Webster and Driskell, 1983). Similarly, implicit personality theory (IPT) suggests that people possess cognitive structures which are representations of personality traits and their inferential relations. Physically attractive and unattractive serve as different social categories that link to a variety of evaluative dimensions like sociability and intellectual competence (Eagly et al). There are also alternative accounts inspired by evolutionary theories. According to the evolutionary byproduct account, the beauty advantage is an unintended consequence of a bias that originally evolved for mating and mate selection purposes. The tendency to value attractive potential partner is deeply embedded in human psychology that it extends to non-mating social interaction (Mulford et al., 1998).
- Parallel with theoretical development, empirical studies have largely confirmed the robustness of the beauty-as-good stereotype while providing more nuanced modification of theories. These empirical studies are characterized by a bunch of meta-analyses taken in 1990s. In 1991, Eagly et al. applied implicit personality theory to the beauty-is-good stereotype. By synthesizing previous empirical studies, the author verified that the beauty-is-good effect is not a broad, general phenomenon but is more pronounced in areas such as social competence and interpersonal ease. A key underlying mechanism is that attractive people elicit positive reactions from others, which is more accessible information for perceivers. Although the authors suggested that the perception of true covariance between attractiveness and social competence also plays a role, they provided no empirical evidence for this link. This gap was filled by following meta-analyses, as researchers began to reflect on whether the beauty-is-good effect is a truly stereotype. For example, Feingold investigated the links between attractiveness and perceived and measured personality traits. By investigating a wide variety of traits ranging from sociability, dominance, mental health, and intelligence, Feingold found virtually no covariance of these traits with attractiveness. However, this finding was not replicated by subsequent meta-analysis of Jackson (1995), who reported a significant association between attractiveness and intelligence in children, thus supporting the expectancy theory or the self-fulfilling prophecy (Darley 1980).

- The debate on the discrepancy between perceived and measured association between attractiveness and traits persists despite a bunch of meta-analysis in 1990s and remains contentious across various traits. New theories were proposed to account for the covariance between traits and their perception. 
- The first relevant trait is intelligence. Zebrowitz et al. proposed a developmental model of attractiveness-intelligence relations, suggesting that multiple developmental paths, for example, genetic and environmental influences, would contribute to their association. Contrary to previous meta-analyses, intelligence was associated with attractiveness from childhood to middle adulthood. By refining the the good genes hypothesis (Thornhill 1990), Zebrowitz et al. proposed the bad genes hypothesis and the face overgeneralization hypothesis. Based on these accounts, attractiveness predicts intelligence only in its lower levels but people overgeneralize this association to the full range of attractiveness. Inspired by these findings, another evolutionary account between intelligence and attractiveness, the assortative mating account, was proposed and directly against previous argument for taking beauty-is-good effect as stereotypes (Kanazawa 2004). The assortative mating account generalize to other traits as long as they help men attain higher status and make them more likely to mate with more attractive women. A recent version of the assortative mating account also accomodate potential nonlinear relationship between traits (Conroy Beam 2017). However, the predictive power of assortative mating account can be constrained in monogamous societies. 
- A second trait worth discussing is physical health. The inconsistency between health and its association to attractiveness exists in both theoretical account and empirical findings. Theoretically, the good genes hypothesis argues that health status is not merely the presence of disease or not. Instead, it is the ability to convert biological energy into fitness (Thornhill). Accordingly, the authors found fluctuating asymmetry, a component contribute to low attractiveness, is negatively associated with self-reported respiratory infections (Thornhill and Gangestad, 2006). Contrary to the good genes hypothesis, the bad gene hypothesis mentioned above predict that attractiveness is a valid cue for health only in its lower halve, while the relationship between perceived health and attractiveness was inflated by overgeneralize this link to the full range of attractiveness (Zebrowitz). Mirror the debate in theories, empirical evidence reported mixed findings in whether attractiveness is a reliable indicator of physical health (Weeden 2005).

The literature review identified multiple meta-analysis targeting at both perceived and measured relationship between attractiveness and theoretically relevant traits. However, these reviews are mostly conducted 30 years ago without synthesizing more recent empirical findings. The current study aims to conduct a more comprehensive meta-analysis on the perceived and measured associations between attractiveness and key traits. Besides attractiveness, we decide to include four traits that are theoretically relevant: intelligence, health, dominance, and sociality. The first two traits are selected due to more recent debates in the literature, while the later two are selected due to their key roles in person perception. 

The current study advances the current literature by addressing several issues that are unsolved by previous reviews. First, there are more recent debates on the discrepancy between perceived and measured association with attractiveness. Many of these findings challenged the results in previous meta-analyses and it is unclear whether these findings turn over established conclusions. Second, as mentioned above, new accounts as well as predictions for both measured and perceived traits are proposed. Whether these new theories are supported across empirical findings remains unclear. For example, the assortative mating account predicts that, if person perception is biased by the beauty-is-good stereotype, then there are discrepancies in the reliability of trait judgment, depending on the extend they are influenced by attractiveness (Conroy). This phenomenon would not be predicted if true associations are warranted. 

Title: Perceived and Measured Associations Between Attractiveness and Key Traits: A Bayesian Meta-Analysis

Abstract: The relationship between attractiveness and a variety of traits, such as intelligence, health, sociability, and dominance, remains a topic of debate in the current literature. This study aims to clarify the equivocal findings surrounding these associations by exploring both the actual correlations and how people perceive them. Specifically, we investigate whether individuals systematically overestimate or underestimate these associations. By combining an analysis of the discrepancies between measured and perceived correlations with a meta-analytic synthesis of their reliability, this research tests competing theories of person perception related to attractiveness and its consequences.

不如改模拟，一个是模拟自我实现，一个是monogamous society，另一个，multiple level of assortative mating，还有一个是ecological fallacy，比如人们有一个假定，就是assortment on mate value，然后高mate value的人中IQ和A高的比率高，而低mate value的人中低IQ和低A的比例高，就会形成一个生态谬误



是一种artificial：一个首要问题是，变量的定义不明确而且抽象。这可以从attractiveness只有37%的inter rater agreement看出。更严重的问题是，当perceiver只有很少的线索但是要推断很多不确定的东西时，这个线索可能被过度利用，从而导致观测之间很高的相关。具体来说，被试并没有一种明确的定义，所以A可能只是其他一些变量的结果，比如Cunningham说的，哪些哪些contribute to A。同样的，和A相关的东西，比如IQ，也是一些抽象的变量，导致人们只能用外部线索，比如某些受到文化学习影响导致的某些面部特征和能力的关联进行推断。而这个推断的结果被进一步当作attractiveness的线索。所以感知到的intelligence和attractiveness高度相关的时候，说明可能其中一个是另一个推断的结果，而不是说两个都基于外部线索推断。比如看我第一年论文的那张特质的网络图，attractiveness和其他各个community的节点都有联系。

此外，即使存在trait和attractiveness都基于外部线索推断，而非心理层面的推理，我们认为这种情况对某些特质的可能性也不大。对health来说，其更多是一种生理指标，更多的证据也指出，attractiveness和health是有条件的相关，比如在health的某些参数范围（中低值）时和attractiveness有相关，这种可能为感知觉提供了合理的外部线索。但是对更多心理特质，比如intelligence，并不需要演化出面部或者生理特征来表示。因为如果是这样，心理学就完全不需要花费数十年时间开发智力测试。尽管Zebrowitz在bad gene hypothesis中也指出智力可能可以通过进化出apparent cue来增加mating中的成功率，但是这种特质也可以通过行为展现，并不一定需要appearance。

如果physical appearance确实能提供一部分心理特质的信息，那么我们预期其范围和作用条件更苛刻。其中一种可能性是性别二态性。比如Kleisner et al. 2014 发现，IQ scores significantly affects the perception of intelligence in men. 作者认为，其中一种解释是智力有性别二态性，比如某些genetic association to sex steroid hormones. 另一种可能是对女性而言，识别男性的智力是一种适应性任务，因为女性长短期关系中对智力的偏好不同。



还有一种可能就是，测量问题和artificial，IQ是很具体的变量，而且很抽象，人们只能用外部线索来衡量，比如用学业成绩，但是这个又受到很多因素影响，一来二去生态效度就差了。一种可能是1990 Cunningham那篇论文，A只是一些其他变量的自然结果，或者说其本质是inductive的。可能两个测的不是一个东西，A是态度，其他是trait，感知到的trait影响到我们的态度罢了

性别二态性，Kleisner2014的讨论有很多有趣的假设。Talamas 2016的intro和结论也很重要

Health这个是生理特质，其他是心理的，所以可能可以解释为什么health以外的都不准。虽然上面说了intelligence也可以作为signaling effect，但是并不一定要用面孔来表示，比如miller认为是幽默。这种可以直接通过行为展示的，没有必要再用其调控外表。



然后看2005的meta，其实还是有二态性的, 还有mengelkoch。因为A这个东西的构成主要是fitness，但是男性的mate value并不完全是这个，所以可能女性需要这种展示。



a 2022 study linked perceived attractiveness to multiple immune markers—self‑reported health, in vivo inflammation and white‑blood‑cell profiles, and in vitro immune assays—with distinct, sometimes sex‑specific patterns, while a 2024 investigation showed that poor‑health symptoms and greater skinfold thickness negatively predicted facial attractiveness, that men with higher testosterone and lower cortisol appeared more attractive, and that exercise and stress impacted attractiveness via these health and adiposity pathways.

## Simulation: Perception

也可以得到这样的结果，就是weight的分布是对称的均匀分布，稀疏刺激导致一个BA model的相关很高，但是如果刺激完全随机，那么相关就有了。现实中，不同节点的环境激活可能存在相关，比如male和masculinity的环境刺激是相关的，或者说一个刺激他们的初始激活是相关的。我们这里要说明的是，即使不考虑相关环境，也可以得到node的相关。这是因为反馈系统消除了噪声的影响。

在现实中这种情况会更糟，如果大家选类似的词，而且本身网络节点独立性的假设是不容易满足的，除了node之间影响带来的相关，还有测量上的相关。很多如果是正的系数，正反馈也会使得其不断增加。

目前少了一个假设，即权重是怎么生成的。不太可能是随机，因为随机会生成很多压制路径。另外，看Cramer 2010，很多都是正的连接在一起。

想想非参数贝叶斯怎么解释这种category之间的抑制关系。我的结论是，所有link都是正数，这个数值描述的是similarity，我们的心理表征不需要表征任何负的相关，但是依然可以在作答上产生强的负相关。比如White and Black，可能因为不相似，导致两个node的最短路径比较长，比如step = 4，然后White的激活也导致了Black的激活，但是激活很弱。所以本质上他们是正相关，但是环境刺激中，激活W和B的线索是极强的负相关，那么虽然在mental representation中他们是正相关，最后在measure上仍然是负相关。

另外，在激活上会有一个suppression，就像spreadr那篇论文说的一样，不一定是早上想的那个关系。这也可以解释为什么第一年的项目观测到这么多zero-inflated distribution，因为没有某个刺激，激活了fail，所以才看到了很多这种分布和负相关。kind是泊松分布，因为从Oosterhof 2008的论文可以看出，kind，nice这种是从情绪的valence来得到的，线索非常明显。

基于这个思路，得到概念心理表征的方法就是，首先估计出一个环境的covariance matrix，然后从measured covariance matrix中剔除

多刺激情况相关比量表更低，应该是因为没有average across participants



# Small-world networks induce seemingly low-dimensional psychology under constrained stimuli

Research in social cognition has long emphasized low-dimensional models to explain how people perceive and infer their own social behaviors and those of others. These models suggest that people often relying on broad evaluative dimensions like warmth and competence in generating numerous facets of judgments. However, emerging evidence from naturalistic contexts reveals that social judgments are complex and high-dimensional. To reconcile these findings, we propose a novel perspective: trait inferences, and possibly broader social knowledge, are represented by a network structure shaped by specific growth dynamics. This growing dynamics preserves high-dimensional richness that qualifies the navigation in complex social environment. The growing pattern endows the network the small-world property, indicating that nodes like traits are surprisingly close to each other and thus the activation of a single node can be readily pass to seemingly unrelated node. Prior studies on social cognition heavily relied on constrained stimuli like face images, which may only activate a limited number of nodes that directly link to external input. We proved that the small-world property can induce high correlations between measures and thus seemingly dimensions when constrained stimuli are used. Thus, we provided an alternative explanation that the famous beauty-is-good halo effect and the dimension models across various domains in social cognition can be viewed as emergent properties of the interaction of constrained input and a growing network. We ended by proposing researchers moving beyond low-dimensional paradigms.

Research in social cognition has long emphasized low-dimensional models, suggesting that people perceive social behaviors using broad evaluative dimensions such as warmth and competence. However, emerging evidence from naturalistic settings reveals that social judgments are far more complex and high-dimensional. To reconcile these findings, we propose a novel perspective: trait inferences—and potentially broader forms of social knowledge—are represented as a growing network with small-world properties. The small-world structure implies that traits are surprisingly close to one another, even in very large networks, allowing activation to spread efficiently across the system. Constrained stimuli, such as isolated face images, may activate only a limited subset of this network, giving rise to an apparent low-dimensional structure. We demonstrate how this network-based account can reinterpret classic findings, including the beauty-is-good halo and dimensional models, as emergent properties of constrained input. We conclude by advocating for a shift beyond low-dimensional paradigms in social cognition research.

## Introduction

In social cognition, researchers have long sought to understand how people represent their perception, categorization, and judgment of their own behavior and those of others. In terms of Marr's level of analysis, this characterizes the “How” question of cognition. The answer to this how question has been dominated by low-dimensional models, ranging from trait inferences, personality, stereotypes, facial attributions, emotions, to mental states. A key characteristics of these low-dimensional accounts is that mental representations of social behavior are attributed as low complexity or equivalent to mental shortcuts. Take a major area of interests, trait inference, as an example. Trait inference has been cast as an inductive‐reasoning problem: given a set of perceptual cues (e.g., facial appearance, behavior, group membership), people infer the targets' underlying personality characteristics or social categories. A recent low-dimensional model suggests that people make inferences largely based on “warmth”, “competence”, “femininity”, and “youth”.  

This low-dimensional perspective emerged from two major threads of research spanning more than fifty years. First, the ‘‘beauty-is-good’’ halo effect illustrated how a single attribute—physical attractiveness—predicts judgments of intelligence, health, and moral character, suggesting that perceivers collapse information along common evaluative dimensions. Second, seminal studies mapped the dimensionality of trait perception, demonstrating that a small number of latent factors can account for a broad array of trait inferences—from personality facets and emotional judgments to stereotypes and facial attributions. Despite the enduring influence of low-dimensional models, a growing body of evidence supports a high-dimensional view of social cognition. In trait inference, for instance, factors beyond the traditional two or three dimensions have been uncovered under naturalistic stimulus conditions, revealing as many as twenty-eight distinct trait dimensions (Kramer et al., 2020). Similar high-dimensional patterns have been documented in emotion perception (Cowen & Keltner, 2017), stereotype content (Bastian & Haslam, 2006), aesthetic judgments, and action recognition (Chandrasekaran et al., 2013). 

To reconcile these divergent findings, we introduce a novel perspective on trait inference and potentially broader domains of social cognition. We propose that mental representations of social knowledge like traits emerge as a small-world network structure shaped by a specific growth pattern. In such networks, numerous nodes are maintained yet remain proximity, creating the appearance of low-dimensional structure when constrained stimuli are used. This network framework not only accounts for prior observations in trait perception but also generalizes to multiple social cognitive domains.

The current perspective is structured as follows. First, we briefly reviewed previous findings on both low- and high-dimensional psychology across various domains in social cognition, including studies on psychological dimensions and the beauty-is-good effect. Second, based on these findings, we introduced the network model. This sections concerns three aspects of the network: what is the general structure of the abstract social knowledge like traits, what is the process operating on the network structure, and how the structure and process interact under certain environmental input. We raised our key argument in the third part. By reinterpreting previous low-dimensional psychology based on the network model, we argue that small world properties induce seemingly low dimensional psychology under constrained stimuli. Last, we linked the network to neural, developmental, and cross-cultural studies and propose future directions. 

## The low- and high-dimensional account of person perception

To illustrate the low-dimensional account, we reviewed two thread of topics that have been widely studied for over 50 years. The first line is the beauty-is-good halo effect. The second stream focus on the dimensional models of person perception.

### The beauty-is-good effect and the dimensional models of person perception

The landmark study of the beauty-is-good effect dates back to 1972, when Dion and colleagues demonstrated that people tend to attribute positive qualities like  as socially desirable and competent to physically attractive individuals. In a typical task, participants watch face images vary in attractiveness and then rate each figure in multiple traits. Subsequent research, especially a few large-scale meta-analytic reviews in 1990s, confirmed the robustness and prevalence of this effect. Notably, Eagjy et al. (1991) demonstrated that the effect is not a uniformly generalizable phenomenon but is more pronounced in interpersonal domains such as social competence while weaker in intelligence and integrity. Accompanying meta-analyses kept debating on whether the ground truth contributed to the effect (Feingold, 1992; Jackson et al., 1995; Langlois et al., 2000), with evidence for minimal to no correlation between attractiveness and measured traits while some anecdotal evidence between intelligence and attractiveness. Among the numerous traits that may affected by attractiveness, intelligence and health have received particular research focus. One possible evolutionary account for the real association between attractiveness and health/intelligence is the good-gene hypothesis, suggesting that attractiveness signals high values on these two traits. Build upon this hypothesis and careful investigation on the correlation between attractiveness and perceived or measured traits, Zebrowitz and colleagues raised the face overgeneralization account. They argued that facial attractiveness serves as a valid cue to intelligence and health primarily at medium-to-low ranges of facial quality. However, perceivers tend to generalize the real but limited association across the entire attractiveness spectrum, thus inducing the beauty-is-good effect. More recent studies and meta-analysis provided additional supports for the beauty-is-good effect while the weak associations between attractiveness and measured traits. In summary, the beauty-is-good effect suggested an overly simplified strategy people used in trait inference. 

While the attractiveness halo effect focus on a single pair of association, another stream of person perception research focus on the overall structure of trait associations, or more broadly, the structure of social cognition. A long-standing tradition assumes that social inferences about others are structured in a low-dimensional latent space. Accordingly, each inference is a combination of a few latent psychological construct. The search for psychological dimensions trace back to 1946 when Asch pioneered research on impression formation. By asking participants to describe a person after listening to a list of traits of the person, Asch found that participants’ descriptions differed dramatically when he changed certain trait words in the list (e.g., from warm to cold), emphasizing their centrality in impression formation. By reanalyzed Asch's data, Wishner revealed that a trait's influence on impressions depends on its intercorrelations with other traits in the list: the higher intercorrelations, the greater the influence. This finding justified applying dimension reduction methods like factor analysis to identify the source of variations in social inferences. For instance, Rosenberg et al. (1968) identified two to three dimensions (e.g., sociality and intellectual desirability) summarizing trait inferences in impression formation. Subsequent investigations continued the search of dimensions in social cognition, with two dimensions (the Big Two model) recurrently emerge across domains and decades. For instances, the warmth and competence dimensions underlie stereotypes toward social groups. Many studies have also a few more factors, such as three dimensions for social judgment (Brambilla et al., 2021), four factors of face attributions (Lin et al., 2021), and the five-dimensional latent space of personality (Goldberg, 1990). 

Despite the numbers and interpretations of dimensions being found, most studies agree that a few dimensions account for most variance in behavioral measures. Although these dimensions can be framed as a statistical summary of social cognition, the more prevalent method, like factor analysis, implies unobservable but meaningful latent constructs. Indeed, the commonly found Big Two dimensions are related to targets' intention and corresponding capability to implement the intention. Therefore, these factors are considered evolutionary adaptive and should be fundamental (Fiske et al., 2007; Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008; Zebrowitz & Montepare, 2008). Similar interpretation applies to other factors like attractiveness. Also, a low-dimensional space is justified by the limited capacity of the mind when dealing with complex social environments (Olivola & Todorov, 2010). 

### Empirical findings of the high-dimensional social cognition

In contrast to the low-dimensional account, recent advances in social cognition advocates a high-dimensional account of person perception. These studies refute the idea that a few factors are sufficient in capturing various domains of social cognition. For example, by allowing participants to freely describe target individuals using their own words, Nicolas and colleagues found 40 dimensions based on social group labels (e.g., morality, sociability, and ability). The more recent studies are characterized by two distinctive features. First, rather than specifying a few factors and preselected a few items for ratings a-priori, recent studies using more diverse items and response data. For example, by asking participants rating 4,659 face images in terms of 48 emotions and mental states, Brooks et al. showed that there are 28 dimensions of facial movements captured by a deep neural network. Second, rather than using cropped faces or short verbal descriptions used in prior studies, these studies focus on more naturalistic stimuli that convey rich information stream or multisensory cues ranging from naturalistic images to videos. For example, Cowen and Keltner used 2185 short video clips to induce participants' emotions, which portrayed an wide range of psychologically significant situations like weddings. Under this more naturalistic setting, computational model identified 27 emotion dimensions. The more diverse information stream and more identified factors suggest that prior constrained stimuli may impede the recovery of psychological dimensions. When different sensory cues are presented, the mind may weighs and integrates them based on their reliability (Bayes integration) and produce different responses that give raise to different factors. Indeed, when multiple cues are available, even cues that are not directly related to judgment played a role in perception by shaping the utilization of predictive cues.

While most recent studies stick to the dimensional account, there are also evidence indicating the dimensional model may not be sufficient. Although Connor et al. found 13 dimensions of facial attributions based on naturalistic face images, these latent factors only explained 38% of the data's variance. In another study, Lu and Lin also found that a 25-factor model can only capture 15% variance of impressions of targets in naturalistic videos. The authors directly compared the factor model and a sparse network model that treat each description as an unique measure while no latent factors underpins. It turns out that a network model may better align the mental representation of social cognition in more naturalistic settings.

In summary, given the sharp contrast between the low- and high-dimensional account of social cognition, a careful reexamination of the underlying mental representation is required. While simply increasing the number of dimensions help capturing the data's variance, it remains unclear how this mental representations rise up and how they interact with the environmental input. When the dimensionality is high and empirical studies comparing different models are missing, one may also reconsider other forms of representations that better align with human's cognitive architecture. 

## A growing network model of social cognition

### Network structure, processing, and their interactions

Cognitive scientists has long been viewing the mind as inherently associative and thus understanding the mind requires the investigation of mental processing upon a network structure (Siew; ). Early studies come from network models of semantic knowledge. In their landmark study, Collins and Quillian suggest that concepts are represented as nodes in a tree-structured hierarchy. Given the elegance of this tree structure, it may only apply to taxonomically organized concepts like classes of animals and cannot generalize to other classes of mental representations like color perception, face perception, friendship relations, and so on (Kemps 2008). 

Several disjointed field from sociology and physics provided additional insights on network structure. In early 1960s, sociologist Ithiel de Sola Pool and mathematician Manfred Kochen raised the concept of small world in their analysis of social connections. Although the manuscript remained unpublished until 1978, it has been widely circulated and inspired the famous small-world experiment by Milgram (1967). The key idea from these studies can be framed under the phrase the six degrees of separation by playwright John Guare, suggesting that people can reach out to anyone in a society by consulting the friends of friends with a few iterations. Meanwhile, in random graph theory, a domain that is unware by sociologists at that time, Erdos and Renyi proposed the random network model. The random network would emerge a giant component in which nodes are connected to each other as the average degree increases, facilitating the small-world property. As a result, the diameter of the network characterizing the largest distance between any two arbitrary nodes are negligible in terms of the size of the network (e.g., number of nodes). 

In real world, however, nodes, ranging from concept representations to individuals in a social network, are not connected randomly. The random network model predicts that the number of edges a node has, or more formally the degree of a node, follows a Poisson distribution. However, pioneering studies of the World Wide Web by Barabasi found that the probability that a web page has k links follows a power law distribution. The power law distribution implies the scale-free stationary state, thus different nodes can differ in their degrees across magnitude orders. Subsequent empirical studies showed that, many real-world networks, ranging from cell to the Internet, converge to this scale-free architecture. In their 1999 Science paper, Barabasi and Albert showed that two mechanisms, growth and preferential attachment, are the underlying causes of this common pattern.

We argue that there are computational grounds supporting the plausibility of these two mechanisms underlying social cognitive representations, particularly in domains such as trait inference. First, a growing structure helps an individual to strike a balance between complexity and tractability. Human minds are finite, therefore there should be a tractable way to form complex representations. This reasoning has been expressed by the theory of cognitive development of Piaget. According to Piaget, while encountering new information, a child can either assimilate the information to their current understanding of the world, or accommodate the information by modifying their current understanding. Despite beginning with a simple representation, these two processes accumulates complexity of the mental representation and enable the navigation in complex social environment. From an evolutionary perspective, this gradual development of mental representation has computational advantages. If a representation is adaptive, such as correctly identity the trait of a potential mate or collaborator, then there is no reason to expect that all or most of these knowledge would be present at birth or early childhood. Given the computational costs of these representations, individuals typically develop them at later life stages when they are required. For example, one may not possess how fitness relevant traits like attractiveness and health are associated before fully sexually matured and thus the mating motive is less salient. Social interactions are hierarchically structured across the lifespan (Neel), such as self-protection precedes status seeking and mate seeking. Thus, concepts related to mating can be acquired later than those related to social threat (e.g., warmth) without influencing the navigation in social contexts. 

Although seemingly related to early functional explanations of the dimensional models that both valence and dominance are fundamental because they help perceivers determine the target's intentions and the capability to implement the intentions, this growing perspective does not hold a fundamental and fixed representation of social cognition. It also differs from previous dimensional models that emphasize the human's cognitive limitations and thus a low-dimensional representation should be justified. Instead, a tractable and simple rule for organizing environmental information should be considered, while allowing for a high-dimensional and complex representation aligning with the sophisticated social environment. 

The second mechanism, preferential attachment, characterizes how the new information like new constructs are incorporated into the established mental representation. Mathematically, preferential attachment is equivalent to a discrete-time stochastic process called the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) that has been widely used in nonparametric Bayesian models. These models are used to explain human categorical cognition. More recently, CRP has been used to explain group formation and subgrouping in stereotype formation, providing the justifications for social cognition. More intuitively, preferential attachment and CRP characterize the rich-get-richer pattern that nodes with higher degrees are more likely to absorb new concepts. In stereotype formation, this can be representing as categorizing a new individual to a more prevalent group; while in trait inference, this may reflect the process that the perceiver may first consider the link between a new concept like intelligence with an established and important concept like attractiveness. Additional justification of preferential attachment comes from the more recent paradigm of cognitive modeling. Resource rational analysis showed that the CRP-like mathematical form naturally emerges from a clustering process seeking to minimize the complexity of mental representations. When defining complexity as the entropy of the cluster assignment distribution, the most efficient use of limited cognitive resources favors assigning new items to existing clusters in proportion to their current size—exactly as in the CRP and preferential attachment. Therefore, preferential attachment can be a principled consequence of optimizing for low-entropy, capacity-efficient representations.

With the above cognitive structure, the processes operating upon this architecture and how they are subjected to environmental input can be specified. One prominent idea in cognitive science is spreading activation, in which activation of one concept in semantic memory can be spread to and activate adjacent nodes in the network. There are several aspects worth mentioning. First, the spreading activation follows a recursive fashion and thus the initially activated node could receive feedback from closely related nodes that are activated. Second, the activation can be a limited cognitive resource that decay quickly over time and distance, or alternatively, represented as a tendency to decay back to the resting activation. Therefore, in a large network with long average path lengths, a few activations can be quickly vanished before propagating to the whole structure. 

The processing operating on specific network structure is also governed by environmental inputs and their interaction with the nodes. According to the dynamic interactive theory of person perception, some nodes can be easily activated by visual and auditory cues. Indeed, trait evaluation related to "valence" is sensitive to features
resembling expressions signaling. While more abstract inferences like personality may rely on more detailed behavior observations. Thus, the interaction between environmental inputs and spreading activation can be understood as an endowment of initial activations of a few nodes, which then pass their activations to closely related nodes in a recursive manner.    

### Accessing the feasibility of the network model 

Although no empirical studies directly evaluate the small-world topology of such network in social cognition, the feasibility of this network representation can be preliminary accessed based on neural, developmental, and cross-cultural studies. 

The proposed network lies in algorithmic-level analysis, which is constrained and build upon the implementation level which specifies how the representation is instantiated in the circuits of a brain. The first possibility is a localist representation, in which an individual node (e.g., trait concept) maps to a single neuron or a very small, dedicated group of neurons. Early studies on the neural network of the worm C. elegans has found a small-world structure. The similar topology was subsequently found in cats, macaque monkeys, and even humans, providing the neural feasibility for a growing network model. However, statistical analysis of semantic network that may relate to social cognition suggests its scale-free property. This property implies differences in node degrees across magnitude, which contradicts with the finding that neurons have fairly similar number of connections (Kandel, Schwartz, & Jessell, 1991). Future studies are required to analyze the statistical property of the network of social cognition. A second possibility is the distributed view. From this perspective, an individual node is represented by the connectivity between related neurons and their activations (Freeman 2011; Ma). For example, according to a recently proposed high-dimensional model of social impressions, a trait impression is an equilibrium that converged by thousands of neurons in a recurrent processing. Neural imaging studies supported this distributed view by showing that the medial prefrontal cortex represents both warmth and competence, thus the Big Two dimensions can be represented by the same neural ensemble but with different activities.

kind 4.89 (875), nice 3.95 (306), pretty 4.09 365, smart 1455 5.50 / 31124

From a developmental perspective, there are both good theoretical reasons and empirical evidence for each a network. Theoretically, as mentioned above, preferential attachment achieves a cost-benefit efficiency across the lifespan. Also, by gradually building up the network by adding new nodes with only a few links in a relatively long time scale, the network remains sparse. The sparsity could reduce the links and energy maintained at the neural level while activations can easily pass over the large network due to small-world topology. Empirically, the growing network model predicts higher degree and centrality of early acquired nodes. There are two lines of studies provided the evidence. In the first line of research, age-of-acquisition ratings for more than 30,000 English words showed that words related to previously identified dimensions are acquired early. For example, "nice" is estimated to be acquired at 3.95, ranked 365 out of 31124 words (top 1.17%). Similarly, kind (estimated acquisition age 4.89), pretty (4.09), and smart (5.50) are all early acquired and thus should have more connections in the network. Since these traits are related to readily accessible cues, they can distributed their activation to other nodes quickly and thus induce high covariance (e.g., dimensions). A second thread of research found that facial attributions of the Big Two dimensions showed robust child-adult agreement. These studies provide supports for a growing network, because network structures of these nodes are acquired early in life. Also, a network perspective is supported by the finding that consensus on warmth judgment based on faces varying in warmth (within-concept judgment) increases with age while adults showed lower consensus while evaluating faces varying in competence as mean or nice (between-concept judgment). A child's network of the concept "warmth" may only contain a random portion of all nodes related to warmth due to his current developmental stage, which resulted in low consensus between children. However, since children's network is less differentiated, activations on nodes related to "warmth" can be easily pass to nodes related to "competence" rather than circulating between different nodes related to warmth. This leads to the seemingly anomalous result in Cogsdill. 

Cross-cultural studies lend further credits to a growing network model. When investigating the generalizability of the Big Two model of face perception, a large scale study based on 41 countries reported inconsistent results, with some regions found more than two factors. Moreover, a recent study applying network analysis found considerate differences in connectivity between traits, social categories, and mental states. These findings indicated that a low-dimensional factor model could obscure important details in mental representation of social cognition. The regional difference implies that individual nodes like trait judgments are associated differently (Dongwon) depend on different sociocultural context, which may be better captured by a more fine-grained network representation.

## Small world properties induce low-dimensional psychology under constrained stimuli

Given the elaboration of the network structure, processing, and their interactions, we now raise our chief argument that previously observed low-dimensional psychology can be understood as an emergent phenomenon when environmental input is constrained. To illustrate this argument, we first provide a formal analysis on the network model, deriving the distance between nodes (e.g., traits in person perception) and their correlations. While we provide intuitive and accessible demonstration in the main text, more rigorous mathematical derivations can be found in the supplementary materials. Once we finished analyzing these statistical properties, we link them to the well established findings in social cognition introduced above.

A network model generated based on growth and preferential attachment is a scale-free network. Although a randomly connected network (e.g., the random network model) can exhibit the small world property, a scale-free network has been proved to be ultra-small. Specifically, the average distance between nodes scales with InIn N, rather than the typical In N seen in random networks, where N is the size of the network. This ultra-small behavior arises due to hubs. These are nodes with very high degree and can connect distant parts of the network in only a few steps. Therefore, seemingly unrelated nodes can rapidly expand their reachable space and achieve comparable activation levels.

To get an intuition of how close different nodes are, we can derive the probability that two nodes with degree $k_i$ and $k_j$ have a distance of $d$ (e.g., separated by $d-1$​ nodes). The derivation is based on the configuration model in complex network theory, which is a commonly used starting point for deriving properties of a complex network. It is intuitive to find that, the probability of two nodes to directly connected is proportional to both degrees. The higher the degree of a node, the higher the probability that it will link to another node of interest. This argument holds for any arbitrary  distance, but is enlarged exponentially by an additional factor related to the distribution of the degree in the network. In our simulation, this factor ranges from 15 to 25. Thus, the probability of distance 2 would be fairly large for two nodes with moderate degrees. In real world situation, this probability would be even higher for nodes with high degrees, because of the empirically observed assortative mixing that high degree nodes tend to connect to other high degree nodes.

Assuming the spreading of activation has some random noise at each step, then the correlation between the activation levels of two nodes is a function of the distance between them, with stronger correlation in shorter distances. Also, if we assume a weighted network, then a weight characterizing how strongly the nodes are connected should be specified for each edge. In psychological network like trait or stereotype representations, these weights can be high and foster strong correlations in activations because the violation of node distinctiveness. In social network, the nodes are clearly distinct as they represent different person or entities. However, for psychological constructs like attractiveness, they are defined in a coarse granularity and could share a nonnegligible amount of variance. 

These analyses provide an alternative explanation for both the beauty-is-good effect and the psychological dimensions. For the beauty-is-good effect, the network perspective would suggest that it is a emergent phenomenon of the activation pattern when only face or body image are provided. Take the most commonly reported attractiveness-intelligence correlation as an example. Suppose the these two constructs satisfied the node distinctiveness assumption, their distance must be extremely small in a high-dimensional network representation. The base factor for their distance could be high due to their relatively high degrees. For attractiveness, it is one of the most accessible cues in person perception and thus could be acquired early in  life. This first-mover advantage ensures its high degree in the network. For intelligence, cultural norms and folk psychology suggest that intelligence has a wide influence on various aspects in life, thus making it widely connected to different traits and stereotypes in a person perception network. When constrained stimuli like faces without auditory and social interactions are presented, the activation in the network is sparse, with a concentration on attractiveness and a few related nodes like gender identity. The activation of attractiveness is quickly passed to intelligence without significant change due to the extremely short distance. In many experimental settings without real social interactions and rich social information, inferences on abstract personality traits can be hard because these nodes receive almost null activation from the environment and thus excessively rely on a few activation nodes that are close to them in the mental representation. 

A prediction of the network model is that, when richer social information is presented and some initial activations conflict each other, the beauty-is-good effect will be weaker or even disappear. Our simulation with diverse environmental input to the network support this argument. This is supported by more recent studies that found only weak or null beauty-is-good effect using naturalistic images or videos, respectively. 

另外一点，这个effect会随着距离的增加而减弱，这个是符合Eagly 1991元分析的，

The similar reasoning also applies to the findings of psychological dimensions. Early studies typically combined face images with pre-selected traits for trait attributions. One may argue that dimensions are identified due to inadequate sampling of traits for judgment. Indeed, numerous studies are based on a-priori theories about dimensions like warmth and correspondingly selected traits, resulting in potential semantic redundance and thus high correlations. However, a systematic sampling of both face stimuli and traits still result in a low-dimensional space. Only when social information is diverse (e.g., companying with auditory and semantic information), the prerequisite of high correlations of dimensions are unsatisfied. This indicates the crucial role of the richness of social information in recovering the accurate form of mental representation of social cognition. The statistical prerequisites for dimensions to emerge is the high shared variance between measures. Specifically, one may measure the sampling adequacy (MSA) for individual words to assess the assumption of the existence of latent constructs. MSA of a single measure (e.g., a trait) ranging from 0 to 1, which can be understood as the reciprocal of the partial correlation between this measure and remaining measures. The higher the partial correlation coefficients, the lower MSA for the word. This indicates that the word has unique associations with other words instead of sharing common variance which may be caused by latent factors. Suppose the mental representation of traits is a network, then value of MSA can be largely influenced by the stimuli. When constrained stimuli are used, like face images, only a few nodes are activated and the activations are spread to other nodes in a parallel flow process. Then, the initially activated node would be similar to a latent construct that uniformly influence surrounding nodes. Since the stimuli are constrained, most nodes heavily rely on the few activated node and thus resulted in large shared variance. 

This reasoning also explains why most factors are those related to readily accessible visual cues. For example, the most prevalent factor warmth is related to features resembling facial expressions. Other examples are attractiveness in the 3-d model and youthfulness in the 4-d model. This process is also similar to the central word mentioned in Asch's pioneering study when the manipulation of a few key words largely change the overall impressions. Therefore, Asch's original study aligns with a network perspective rather than the dimensional perspective. When the stimuli are naturalistic and diverse, the conditional independence assumption can be violated. Although nodes associated with visual input can still serve important anchors, other nodes can access auditory, semantic, and behavior information and thus have their unique variance. This largely decreases common variance between nodes and thus correlations between behavioral measures like trait ratings. When analyzing data under these more naturalistic settings, a low-dimensional space cannot explain the variance between measures. Instead, one may detect communities in the network consist of individual measures like traits, which are clusters based on merely connectivity but not shared variance. Studies on personality and person perception have both identified communities that are semantically similar to previously identified dimensions, which suggests that dimensions can be understood as an emergent property in a network mental representation.

## Moving beyond low-dimensional paradigms in social cognition

Studies on social cognition has been dominated by constrained stimuli that artificially limit the complexity and ecological validity of social information. These approaches, while offering methodological control, may fundamentally distort our understanding of the mental representation of social cognition by creating unreasonably high correlation between measures and a low-dimensional psychology that does not fully capture the reality.

Recent studies have identified persistent concerns about inadequate stimulus sampling in social cognition research (Mondloch et al., 2023; Satchell et al., 2022; Sutherland and Young, 2022). The field's overwhelming focus on white faces represents the most glaring limitation, and while some researchers have attempted to diversify face stimuli, these efforts still operate within a constrained framework—adding diversity along a single dimension (e.g., face) rather than increasing the dimensionality of available information. Similarly, emotion recognition research has been dominated by prototypical facial expressions representing extreme forms of core emotions, potentially overlooking the subtle, context-dependent expressions that characterize real-world interactions. However, recent studies showing that only 14% of eye gaze patterns are directed toward faces in realistic settings when additional social information is available (Varela et al., 2023). In contrast, social interaction in naturalistic contexts involves multiple streams of information—visual cues from actions and behaviors, auditory information, and contextual information. These information streams are sometimes deemed more reliable by participants and thus cannot be neglect in experimental designs. For example, emotion inferences made by participants were well captured by contextual information alone while isolated facial cues are insufficient. It has also been found that relational visual information characterizing how individuals interact could be an important cue human replying on when making social inferences.

The persistence of low-dimensional paradigms may reflect deeper cognitive and cultural biases toward simplicity. People have strong motivations to understand and find meaning in their experiences (Cohen Stotland). Given the complexity of human psychology, this motivation urges researchers to create mental placeholders that establish feelings of certainty and understanding (Eshin). Besides our innate tendency, the cultural norm in social science favors the verbal descriptions rather then mathematics in communicating research findings (Watts, 2017). A low-dimensional account of psychology could have higher fitness during the social transmission. Empirical studies on stereotypes found that, while starting at a relatively high-dimensional trait space, stereotypes about artificially created aliens would gradually degrade to a low-dimensional representation after transmitting through several generations. The similar process could also happen in scientific production and transmission, indicating how our innate tendency distort the dimensionality of psychological science.

Therefore, it is necessary to move beyond both low-dimensional paradigm and mindset in order to advance our understanding of social cognition in more naturalistic settings. We argue that combining the introduction of the complexity of real world social interactions into the study design and the development of mental models that make quantitative predictions would help. First, experiments are simplified models of real-world situations (ABM). Since social cognition like impression formation typically go beyond the single time slice of the glimpse of faces, the experiment should incorporate the remaining essential part like multisensory information and social interactions. However, simply manipulated multiple cues may not be sufficient, as how cues are integrated and combined could largely influence the output (bayes cue integration). This prompts researchers to develop mental representation models that clearly specify how cues are processed and produce the behavioral measures in an experiment. In our case, the mental model is a complex network following growth and preferential attachment, while behavioral measures are mapping from the node activations. An analogy for this model development process can be found in cooking. Just as a recipe describes how to optimally combine ingredients to produce a finished dish, a model represents a general mathematical function that transforms inputs into specific outputs (Crockett, 2016). Both recipes and mental models serve as systematic procedures that reliably convert raw materials—whether ingredients or data—into desired outcomes through well-defined transformations.

## Conclusion

In this perspective, we reviewed two lines of research that have a long tradition in social psychology and reinterpret the findings from a complex network perspective. By reviewing studies over the past 50 years, we framed the beauty-is-good halo effect and the dimensional models across various domains of social cognition as the low-dimensional perspective, as both line of studies featuring high correlations between individual measures. Inspired by more recent advances in high-dimensional social cognition, we suggested that prior low-dimensional findings can be an emergent property of a growing network under constrained stimuli. Mechanistically, the growing network possess the small-world topology that result in short distances between seemingly distanced nodes and thus strong correlation between their activation and behavioral measures. We advocated for moving beyond low-dimensional thinking and paradigms in social cognition to gain more ecologically valid understanding of how people perceive and organize traits and behaviors. 







在person perception，人们花了数十年的时间研究trait inference的组织，也就是trait的结构，其心理表征。更广泛地总结为How question. 

trait inference可以被理解为一个inductive inference的问题，即给定一些环境刺激，对特质进行推断。纵观各个领域，人们有一个传统，就是认为人们有cognitive shortcut, 这主要是受到了认知心理学过去几十年的研究的影响。确实，社会心理学过去的研究似乎支持了low-dimensional psychology，认为人们有非常简单的心理表征。this argument is characterized by two thread of research that spans over 60 years. 第一条是理解trait perception和其他社会认知的维度，研究发现少数latent factor可以解释大部分特质推断的变异。比如少数潜变量来组织numerous facets of traits, emotions, stereotype, face attributions。第二条是beauty-is-good effect，即XXX。说这个是低维的，因为单纯知道A可以也知道IQ，health等等一堆特质，而且他们之间存在高相关。这被认为是一种刻板印象，也有人认为是一种启发式。

尽管对维度和光环效应的研究持续了60年并且不断得到证据支持，近些年，emerging evidence advocates for a high-dimensional social cognition. 比如在trait inference，少数因子并不能很好的捕捉自然刺激下的特质推断，比如之前被认为是只有2个维度的刻板印象被拓展到了28维。证据并不单纯来自trait judgment，情绪，刻板印象，艺术感知，动作都被发现是高维度的。另一方面，尽管早期论文为beauty is good effect提供了一些解释，比如现实中IQ和A就是相关，但是更近的证据表明A和各种特质，比如IQ没有相关，为effect的解释造成了困难。more recent studies using naturalistic stimuli发现这个effect会减弱甚至消失，prompt for a new explanation of this famous effect. 

为了调和最近的研究和过往60年研究的冲突，我们提出了一种新的网络解释作为trait inference。具体来说，我们认为trait inference的表征是基于特定生长方式得到的网络结构，这种生长方式使得其具有小世界特性。小世界特性使得在高维空间中，看似不同的trait其实有非常近的距离。这种网络结构和constrained stimuli的交互导致了观测到的low-dimensional psychology. 尽管我们的出发点是trait inference, our argument can be generalized to various domains in social cognition. 

- Take a major area of interests, trait inference, as an example. Trait inference has been cast as an inductive‐reasoning problem: given a set of perceptual cues (e.g., facial appearance, behavior, group membership), people infer underlying personality characteristics or social categories. Over the past six decades, two dominant threads of research have converged on the notion that trait inference is supported by low‐dimensional cognitive shortcuts.
- To illustrate this account, we reviewed two thread of topics that have been widely studied for over 50 years. The first line is the beauty-is-good effect, or halo effect. The second stream focus on the dimensional models of perception perception. 
- Social cognition has been dominated by low-dimensional theories of how trait inferences, stereotypes, facial attributions, emotions, mental states, and motivations are structured. The characteristics of low-dimensional account is that mental representations are attributed with low complexity or equivalent to heuristics or mental shortcuts. To illustrate this account, we reviewed two thread of topics that have been widely studied for over 50 years. The first line is the beauty-is-good effect, or halo effect. The second stream focus on the dimensional models of perception perception. 



For decades, person perception research has been guided by low-dimensional models (e.g., warmth & competence, agency & communion), consistent with the notion of the cognitive miser and the need to streamline social information. Using data-driven, computational approaches, 4 talks expose a person perception architecture that is far richer and higher-dimensional. Talk 1 uses large language models to reveal that 24 dimensions best capture the thousands of traits people attribute in others. Talk 2 finds that 14 dimensions are needed to account for the richness of perceivers’ stereotypes about dozens of social groups. Using naturalistic videos, Talk 3 finds that open-ended social perceptions are best explained by a high-dimensional neural network of 25+ dimensions. Finally, Talk 4 traces the dynamic process of this high-dimensional architecture, from processing of facial cues to increasingly abstract social impressions. Together, this symposium showcases emerging theoretical and methodological approaches to person perception that raise new questions about the social perceiver – a perceiver who strives to compress social information yet exhibits expansive dimensionality when perceiving others.



Currently, I’m thinking of positioning the review around how a scale-free network generated by simple principles could account for several social cognition findings: Why does the beauty-is-good effect emerge? Why does social cognition organize into low-dimensional spaces? Why do those particular dimensions emerge? Why does interrater agreement on face-based trait judgments vary? Why are children consistent in certain trait inferences? Why do cultural differences in trait attributions arise? The plan would be to review these phenomena and then propose a unifying framework. However, I recognize that some of these arguments were already discussed in your paper.

用限制刺激的问题：膨胀相关，从而得到错误的心理表征。如上所述，即使是网络表征，也会得到类似维度的因子模型。所以我们认为需要改变constrained paradigm，以及这种paradigm后面对应的心理。

在实验设计上，回顾最近的研究，很多都指出现在的研究太关注于white face。即使有efforts on diversify face images like Sutherland and Lin，但是仍然是在一个维度上增加多样性，而不是增加信息的维数。社会互动并不是一个thin slice。实际上，很多其他视觉信息，以及其他维度的信息都能给出很好的线索。比如动作和行为的视觉信息，比如听觉信息，以及场景信息那个贝叶斯线索整合NC。最近也提出用游戏研究人类心理，有一个例子是Eshin的gossip，虽然naturalistic stimuli更好，但是也不能取代naturalistic social interactions。

这种设计的背后可能是我们的低维度认知。理论上，我们喜欢简洁的东西。而认知心理学似乎为此辩护。但是简单的行为不代表不能形成复杂的表征。环境可以帮助我们。赫伯特西蒙。方法上，我们的教育就是这种简化的，偏解释性的方法. 比如没有网络心理测量这个第二代范式

因此我们需要认识论上的改变，从认知偏差到生态理性。简单的启发式可能是认知偏差，但也可能是在单一线索下的合理利用。比如，在刻板印象上采用exemplar model，虽然一直被认为是一种认知shortcut，但其实是贝叶斯推断的近似。更进一步，简单的规则也可以生成复杂的表征。

but this calls for a fundamental epistemological shift from viewing social cognition through the lens of cognitive biases toward embracing ecological rationality. Simple heuristics, often dismissed as cognitive shortcuts, may actually represent optimal solutions given environmental constraints. For instance, exemplar models of stereotyping may capture important aspects of how humans perform approximate Bayesian inference in social contexts.

The path forward requires reconceptualizing the relationship between experimental simplicity and theoretical sophistication. Rather than viewing complexity as a methodological problem to be solved through constraint, we should embrace the inherent complexity of social cognition as fundamental to the phenomena we seek to understand. This shift demands methodological innovations that preserve both the complexity of social cognition and the inferential power of scientific investigation, moving beyond the false dichotomy between experimental rigor and ecological validity.



An alternative evolutionary perspective, the assortative mating hypothesis (Kanazawa, 2004, 2006), offers distinct explanations for attractiveness-trait correlations. It posits that the beauty-is-good effect accurately reflect real associations between these traits that emerge extrinsically through assortative mating rather than intrinsically through shared biological pathways.
