# Small-World-Minds-Create-the-Illusion-of-Low-Dimensional-Social-Cognition-Under-Constrained-Stimuli

Abstract: Research in social cognition has long emphasized low-dimensional models, suggesting that people perceive social behaviors using broad evaluative dimensions (e.g., warmth). However, emerging evidence from naturalistic settings reveals that social judgments are far more complex and high-dimensional. To reconcile these findings, we propose a novel perspective: trait inferences—and potentially broader forms of social knowledge—are represented as a growing network with small-world properties. The small-world topology implies that nodes are surprisingly close to one another, allowing activation to spread efficiently across the network. Constrained stimuli (e.g., isolated faces) activate only a small subset of nodes, whose signals then propagate consistently across the network, producing the appearance of low dimensionality. We demonstrated how this network account can reinterpret classic findings, including the beauty-is-good effect and dimensional models, as emergent properties under constrained input. We advocated for a shift beyond low-dimensional paradigms to better capture the complexity of human social cognition.
